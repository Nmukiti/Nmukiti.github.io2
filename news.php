<p>We believe that children's lives change when their natural passion for learning is nurtured and transformed into habits of life-long learning and reflection. We believe that the world changes as these children learn to serve country and community with wisdom, conviction, and compassion.For more than 60 years, we have offered an education that broadens perspectives, sharpens minds, strengthens bodies, and engages hearts.Academy has a long, proud tradition of scholarly, artistic, and athletic excellence and is considered one of the nation’s top independent schools.Some of the best faculty in the country inspire, mentor, and guide Academy students on their academic journey.The student body comprises approximately half boys and half girls, 51% are students of color, and about 21% are receiving more than $4 million in financial assistance. Financial assistance is based entirely on demonstrated financial need; only after students are admitted and their tuition needs assessed is financial assistance offered. The sixth grade Class of 2023 includes 52% students of color with students coming from 55 different schools.Academy isn’t just an education – it’s a way of life! Our club sponsors, athletic coaches, and faculty and staff are all dedicated to helping students experience Academy life at its fullest…</p>
